## WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT REGULAR EXPRESSION (REGEX)

**Regular expression:** is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is often referred to as /"regex/"

In a simple term, it is an expression used regulary

### Fundamental Concepts of Regular Expressions are:
__Literal Characters__: In most cases, characters in a regular expression match themselves directly. For example, the regex "abc" matches the exact string "abc."

* __Metacharacters__: Regular expressions frequently incorporate special metacharacters, each with a distinct purpose. Some common metacharacters include:

	* /"./" (dot): Matches any single character except a newline.
	* /":/" Matches zero or more instances of the preceding character or group.
	* /"+/": Matches one or more instances of the preceding character or group.
	* /"?/": Matches zero or one instance of the preceding character or group.
	* /"|/" (pipe): Func/tions as an OR operator, enabling you to select from multiple alternatives.
	* /"()/": Groups characters or subexpressions together.
	* /"[]/": Establishes a character class, matching any single character enclosed within the brackets.
	* /"^/": Matches the start of a line.
	* /"$:/" Matches the end of a line.
